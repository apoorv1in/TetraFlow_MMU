# TetraFlow_MMU

*TetraFlow MMU*: A Multi-Material Unit for 3D Printers

TetraFlow MMU is a 4-color MMU inspired by the innovative 3dChameleon MMU. Utilizing a unique cam design, it seamlessly switches between filaments. The compact and simple design, thanks to the cam mechanism, includes a 4-to-1 Y splitter with an integrated filament sensor. Additionally, the MMU features homing functionality for precise and reliable filament switching.
